Interface files are named after the interface they implement with the suffix `.varlink`.

## Keywords

|Keyword          |Description                                                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|interface        |The name of the interface in reverse-domain name notation. It must be the first keyword in the description.|
|[type](#type)    |A custom type. The definition of an object/record/structure.    |
|[method](#method)|A method with input and output parameters/objects               |
|[error](#error)  |The name of the error and and optional data describing the error|

Types, methods, error names need to be unique identifiers in an interface definition; they share the same namespace. They can be referenced by their fully-qualified reverse-domain-name. The method ```GetInfo()``` in the interface ```org.example.test``` is called ```org.example.test.GetInfo```.

## Type
With ```type``` a structure of fields (object) can be defined. Following the ```type``` keyword the type name has to be specified. Type names have to start with an uppercase character and continue with alphanumeric letters. Enclosed in ```()``` the declaration of the various fields follows. Field names start with a lowercase character and continue with alphanumeric letters. ```_``` can appear in the middle of the field name, but not at the beginning or at the end. Object declarations specify a field name followed by a colon and a type. Fields are separated by comma.

```go
type MyType (
   example_bool: bool,
   example_int: int,
   example_float: float,
   example_string: string,
   example_object: object,
   example_enum: (one, two, three),
   example_struct: (first: int, second: string),
   example_array: []string,
   example_dictionary: [string]string,
   example_stringset: [string](),
   example_nullable: ?string,
   example_nullable_array_struct: ?[](first: int, second: string),
   example_other_type: MyOtherType
)
```

|Type             |Keyword |Description                                    |Example                           |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|Boolean          |bool    |_true_ or _false_                              |```flag: bool```                  |
|Integer          |int     |Implementation-specific size, usually `int64`  |```whole: int```                  |
|Floating Point   |float   |Implementation-specific size, usually `IEEE754`|```half: float```                 |
|String           |string  |                                               |```name: string```                |
|Object           |()      |Structure of named types, separated by comma   |```(first: int, second: string)```|
|Enum             |()      |List of names without types, separated by comma|```(this, that, other)```         |
|Map/Dictionary   |[string]|Map of types with a unique string as key       |```[string]int```                 |
|Array            |[]      |Array of types                                 |```[]int```                       |
|Nullable         |?       |Nullable type/Maybe                            |```?string```                     |
|Foreign object   |object  |Foreign untyped/raw object                     |```payload: object```             |

## Method
Method names start with an uppercase character and continue with alphanumeric letters and specify an input and output parameter object.
```go
method Add(a: int, b: int) -> (sum: int)
method Foo(a: int, b: MyType) -> (bar: MyOtherType, baz: float, more: (i: int, f: float, s: string))
```

## Error
Error names start with an uppercase character and continue with alphanumeric letters and optionally carry an error object describing the error. The error is identified by its fully-qualified name. Varlink calls can only return well-defined errors specified in the interface description.
```go
error UnknownAction(action: string, more_data: DetailedError)
```

## Grammar
All whitespace (space, `\t`, `\r`, or `\n`) is ignored, except inside comments, which are started with `#` and extend to the next `\n`.

Comments that start on a new line and are immediately followed by `interface`, `method`, `type` are documentation for that following declaration. These comments may span multiple lines.
